# GitHubCommitViewer

This is a simple POC Android app that can fetch a list of commits from specified GitHub repository. It consists of two screens: first with a search bar and list of previous searches, and a second screen that displays list of commits in the specified repository and an ability to share selected commits to other apps.


# How to run
Mak sure you have Android SDK and Android Studio IDE downloaded and set up. Import the project in Android Studio. IDE will probably prompt you about downloading project dependencies - let it do it's thing. After that pick a device on which to run the app (Android 6 or higher) and click Run.
